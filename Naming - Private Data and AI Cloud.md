# Private Data and AI Cloud

**The Data Cloud You Control**

---

**Private Data and AI Cloud**

* **AI inclusion is strategic** — Governments and enterprises are unlocking budget for AI right now. If you're just "data," you're infrastructure. If you're "data and AI," you're the future. This also positions us against Databricks' "Data Intelligence Platform" framing—they've made AI central to their narrative, so we need to compete on that axis.  
* **"Private" does heavy lifting** — one word captures sovereignty, control, on-prem, regulatory compliance. This is our core differentiator from both Snowflake (cloud-only) and Databricks.  
* **"Data Cloud"** — plants you in Snowflake's category while differentiating. Note: Databricks owns "Lakehouse" and increasingly "Data Intelligence Platform." By using "Cloud" we compete directly with Snowflake's positioning while "Private" creates the contrast. We sidestep Databricks' terminology war entirely.

**The Data Cloud You Control**

* Simple, memorable, contrastive  
* Implies: Snowflake is a data cloud you don't control. We're the one you do. Against Databricks, it highlights that their "openness" marketing doesn't translate to true deployment control—you still run on their managed infrastructure or navigate complex partner arrangements.  
* Works across all audiences without jargon
