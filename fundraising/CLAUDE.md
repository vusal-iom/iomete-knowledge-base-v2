# Fundraising & Investor Documents

## Positioning
- Do not name competitors (Databricks, Snowflake, Cloudera, etc.) outside of dedicated competitive landscape sections. Use category terms like "public cloud data platforms" or "legacy on-prem stacks" instead.
- IOMETE is a category creator. Investor-facing writing should define the market on our terms, not position us relative to incumbents.
