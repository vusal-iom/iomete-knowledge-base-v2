# IOMETE — Series A Investment Memo

*We bring the Cloud Data Platform architecture to the data, rather than forcing the data into the public cloud.*

## 1\) Executive summary

IOMETE is the modern **Private Data Cloud** — a unified, cloud-native **data & AI platform** that runs **entirely within the customer’s secure boundary** (on-prem data centers, private/sovereign clouds, and hybrid environments).

The **cloud-only** era is ending. Enterprises want the productivity of modern cloud data platforms and AI readiness, but a growing share cannot (or will not) move their most valuable data into a vendor-controlled public cloud due to **sovereignty, regulation, and cloud economics**.

IOMETE solves this by **bringing the cloud experience to the data**, rather than forcing data into a public vendor’s SaaS.

**Why this is a Series A breakout:** the platform is proven in the most demanding environments.

* **Scale & displacement**: Dell runs IOMETE at Fortune-50 scale (massive 40PB+), migrating workloads from legacy stacks (Cloudera) and cloud-only vendors (Databricks) to achieve unified governance and cost efficiency.  
* **Depth & sovereignty**: Validated by **5 additional strategic enterprise contracts** — including **2 government organizations** — proving the platform’s depth for highly regulated, sovereign environments.  
* **Trust**: Full enterprise compliance (SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, GDPR).

IOMETE deliberately built the runway first. Now the constraint is no longer “can the product work in the real world?” — it is **go-to-market capacity and execution leverage**. This Series A is about scaling with discipline: hiring senior GTM leadership, building a repeatable enterprise sales motion, and expanding delivery capacity to support larger and more frequent deployments.

## 

## 2\) Positioning

**IOMETE is the first modern Private Data Cloud — giving enterprises a unified, cloud-native data & AI platform that runs entirely within their own secure boundaries.**

This is not “on-prem tooling.” It is cloud architecture applied to private infrastructure: consistent governance, a unified platform experience, and the ability to operate across multiple sites and sovereign clouds as one organizational system.

## 

## 3\) Why now

The “Cloud First” mandate is being replaced by a “Cloud Smart” reality. Three forces are creating urgent demand for a **Private Data Cloud**:

1. **Sovereignty is becoming a hard border.**  
   Regulations (GDPR, AI Act, localized banking laws) are no longer just compliance checkboxes; they are forcing data residency. Enterprises in Europe, MENA, and APAC increasingly cannot legally consolidate all data into US-based public cloud regions.  
2. **Repatriation of workloads.**  
   As cloud bills for storage and egress hit unsustainable levels, large enterprises are actively repatriating steady-state workloads to private infrastructure. They want the experience of the cloud, but the economics of owned infrastructure.  
3. **AI readiness requires a modern stack, not legacy fragmentation.**  
   Enterprises cannot build AI on disjointed, legacy on-prem systems. They need a high-performance Lakehouse foundation (governed, scalable, open) to prepare data for AI — without being forced to move that data to the public cloud.

## 

## 4\) The problem (what customers struggle with)

Large enterprises are trapped in an “**Impossible Choice**”:

1. **The cloud-only path (Databricks/Snowflake)**: Offers speed and a modern developer experience, but requires moving data **outside the security boundary**. For regulated industries and sovereign entities, this creates unacceptable risks around residency, compliance, and unpredictable cloud costs.  
2. **The legacy on-prem path (Cloudera/Hadoop)**: Keeps data safe, but the technology is **heavy, fragmented, and brittle**.  
   * The “Frankenstein” problem: Teams stitch together 10+ components (Hive, Impala, Presto, Spark, Ranger, Atlas) just to run a basic platform.  
   * Operational nightmare: Upgrades are painful, governance is disjointed, and the user experience is inconsistent.

**Result:** High TCO and **data fragmentation**. Teams end up with siloed clusters across regions, duplicated governance work, and an inability to deliver data products at the speed the business requires.

## 

## 5\) The solution (what IOMETE delivers)

IOMETE is the **first cloud-native platform** designed to run inside the customer boundary. We decouple architecture from infrastructure — giving customers a cloud-like experience on their own metal.

### 5.1 Infrastructure-agnostic (build once, deploy anywhere)

IOMETE is not just “hybrid-compatible”; it is **infrastructure-agnostic**. It runs on bare metal, private clouds, or inside a customer’s AWS/Azure VPC. This flexibility lets enterprises place data where regulation or economics dictate, without changing the platform experience.

### 5.2 A single global view across multiple installations

Large enterprises rarely have “one environment.” They have multiple regions, data centers, and clusters — often mixing on-prem and cloud.

IOMETE provides a **global enterprise view** across multiple installation sites, simplifying:

* governance and permissions  
* identity integrations  
* metadata management  
* cross-site data product exchange

Example: Dell runs IOMETE across **six data centers**, while IOMETE provides a unified global view for the organization.

### 5.3 A complete data platform (beyond SQL federation)

Competitors like Starburst or Dremio are primarily query engines. IOMETE is a **full-stack Lakehouse**. We support the full lifecycle — Query, Spark ETL, DataFrame workflows, and streaming — in one platform, replacing multiple point solutions.

### 5.4 Simplicity as a product principle

Where legacy stacks feel like stitched components, IOMETE is built to feel unified and operationally coherent — a core differentiation versus the “kitchen sink” approach of older on-prem platforms.

## 

## 6\) Target Market & GTM Focus

IOMETE wins where data sovereignty and hybrid complexity are non-negotiable.

Primary target regions:

* **USA**: Large enterprises (Healthcare, Finance) pursuing hybrid shifts for cost reduction  
* **EU**: Strong on-prem market driven by GDPR and cloud-exit trends  
* **Middle East**: High-growth “Sovereign AI/Data” market where data cannot leave national borders

6.1 Core use cases

We do not chase born-in-the-cloud startups; we target massive, regulated entities where data gravity prevents a full move to the public cloud.

### Use case A — The distributed global enterprise (Fortune 2000\)

Fortune-2000 organizations operate across multiple sites and mixed environments. IOMETE provides a single governed platform across them, reducing siloed installations and duplicated governance work.

*Reference*: **Dell Technologies** (unified view across 6 global regions).

### Use case B — Holdings with many operating companies

Holdings need one platform purchase that can roll out to subsidiaries, with a shared governance layer and an internal marketplace for data exchange.

*Reference*: **Pasha Holding** rollout via Pasha Technology, enabling multiple companies (banking, insurance, e-commerce, payments). This can become a **$1M+** account as subsidiaries onboard.

### Use case C — “Private SaaS” inside a regulatory boundary (B2B2B)

A sovereign/private cloud provider or central institution can deploy IOMETE once and serve many regulated entities inside a country/region — applying a SaaS-like model to the non-public cloud world while staying within residency constraints.

*Example in progress*: central-bank-style infrastructure enabling a financial vertical within one country.

### Use case D — Government & national data infrastructure (B2G)

Governments are building sovereign cloud approaches and need a governed analytics/AI platform and a data marketplace across agencies. IOMETE makes that practical through a cloud-like experience inside the national boundary.

## 7\) Traction & Capital Efficiency

IOMETE has crossed the chasm from “science project” to mission-critical production. We have achieved best-in-class capital efficiency, proving the product sells through high utility and massive replacement value.

### 7.1 Commercial efficiency (the outlier metric)

* **Hyper-efficient growth**: We reached \~$4M ARR while raising only $2M total seed capital.  
* **Why this matters**: We did not “buy” revenue with heavy burn. We grew because large enterprises have a desperate technical need that IOMETE solves.  
* **Contract quality**: Multi-year enterprise agreements with high retention and expansion potential (e.g., Pasha Holding path to $1M+).

### 7.2 Technical validation (scale & security)

* **Fortune-50 scale:** Proven in production at 40PB+ scale (Dell).  
* **Displacement power:** Replacing entrenched incumbents (Cloudera, Databricks) in live production environments.  
* **Certified trust:** Compliant with SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, and GDPR — clearing procurement hurdles for Government, Healthcare, and Finance.

### 7.3 Top customers (ARR)

* Dell Technologies: $3.5M/year  
* Pasha Holding: $100K/year  
* Central Bank of Azerbaijan: $150K/year  
* Uzbekistan Digital Ministry: $200K/year  
* Overdrive: $30K/year

### 7.4 Retention (early-stage context)

* GRR (2025): \~100% — no churn or downsell  
* NRR (2025): \~333% — driven primarily by significant expansion of the early lighthouse customer (Dell), scaling from \~$0.6M → $2.0M ARR during 2025

*Responsible interpretation:* NRR is currently skewed by one large early customer and reflects early land-and-expand dynamics, not steady-state retention. As the base diversifies, we expect NRR to normalize while remaining expansion-driven.

Base planning assumption: \~130% NRR (best-in-class enterprise software).

### 7.5 Pipeline (next \~2 quarters)

* Qualified opportunities: \~15  
* Average ACV: \~$250K ARR  
* **Implied qualified pipeline (unweighted): \~$3.75M ARR**

Note: pipeline is unweighted; bookings depend on realized win rate and deal timing. Win-rate assumptions will be refined as CRM data matures.

### 7.6 Delivery capacity (current constraint)

* Max parallel implementations: \~2 in parallel

This is a near-term scaling constraint: sales ramp must be paced with delivery capacity to protect time-to-production and customer outcomes.

The **product risk** is effectively retired. The **market risk** is validated by revenue. The Series A is primarily to solve **capacity risk** — building the sales and delivery capacity to harvest demand.

## 

## 8\) Competitive Landscape & Differentiation

The market is crowded, but for the hybrid/sovereign enterprise, every alternative requires a major compromise. IOMETE is the only platform that eliminates the tradeoff between **cloud experience** and **data control**.

Investors and customers typically evaluate IOMETE against three broad approaches:

### A) Public cloud SaaS (the “walled garden” model)

*Examples: Databricks, Snowflake*

* **Compromise**: Assumes **all data** moves into a proprietary cloud ecosystem.  
* **Failure point**: For sovereign entities and cost-conscious enterprises, moving petabytes is legally impossible (residency) or economically untenable (egress).  
* **IOMETE advantage**: We bring the platform to the data, aligning with data gravity and sovereignty.

### B) Legacy on-prem (the “Frankenstein” model)

*Examples: Cloudera, Hadoop distributions*

* **Compromise**: Control, but forces teams to operate a brittle assembly of open-source components.  
* **Failure point**: High operational overhead; upgrades are painful; integration is manual; developer experience is poor.  
* **IOMETE advantage**: A unified, modern platform designed as one product with a cloud-native operating model.

### C) Pure SQL federation (the “partial stack” model)

*Examples: Starburst, Dremio*

* **Compromise**: Great query, but lacks the depth to handle the full lifecycle (ETL, heavy processing, AI workflows).  
* **Failure point**: Customers still need separate compute layers, leading to fragmentation.  
* **IOMETE advantage**: A **comprehensive Lakehouse** — ingest → ETL/DF/streaming → query → AI/BI.

### What makes IOMETE uniquely strong

* **Private Data Cloud architecture**: cloud-native experience deployed into private boundaries  
* **Multi-site / multi-tenant orientation**: one governed view across installations  
* **Scope**: full-stack data platform (Spark \+ SQL \+ AI), not just query  
* **Simplicity**: cohesive UX/ops versus stitched-component stacks

## 9\) Phase Transition: From Founder-Led to Systematized Growth

IOMETE has operated in two deliberate phases: first durability and product correctness, then scaling the commercial machine.

### Phase 1: Validation & durability (completed)

**Mindset:** product correctness over speed. We built a platform that can replace Cloudera and Databricks in Fortune-50 environments with a lean team and founder-led sales.

* 2025 actual: $2.1M ARR (**capital-efficient, high retention**)

### Phase 2: The GTM build (2026 strategy)

**Mindset**: build the engine. 2026 transitions from founder-led sales to a scalable GTM organization.

* **Revenue safety**: As of 2026 Q1, we reached $4M ARR with a $1M weighted pipeline. Our $6M target is highly de-risked.  
* **Real objective**: We are raising to hire and ramp capacity for 2027\.  
* **Execution**: Hire the CRO and the initial cohort of Enterprise AEs and SEs this year. With a \~6-month ramp, the team is fully productive by January 1, 2027\.

**The growth trajectory (the “triple-triple” path)**

We are committing to a top-tier venture growth curve (3× YoY), underpinned by the replacement cycle in the market.

| Year | Target ARR | Status | Phase Focus |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2025 | **$2.1M** | Actual | PMF & Compliance |
| 2026 | **$6.0M** | Plan | Founder-Led → CRO Hire & GTM Setup |
| 2027 | **$18.0M** | Scale | Fully Ramped Sales Team (Net New: \~$12M) |
| 2028 | **$54.0M** | Velocity | Global Expansion |
| 2029 | **$162M** | Category King | IPO Readiness |

**Why capital is required now (the 2027 lag)**

To add $12M net new ARR in 2027, we need a fully ramped sales pod (approx. 1 CRO/VP \+ 12 AEs \+ supporting SDRs/SEs) ready on day 1 of 2027\.

* That requires hiring in mid-2026.  
* Series A funds this J-curve — front-loading talent in 2026 to drive predictable 2027 growth.

## 10\) 24-Month Execution Plan: The Path to Series B

We are deploying capital across two stages: build GTM capacity, then harvest revenue to reach Series B metrics.

### Phase 1: The build (first 12 months — 2026\)

*Focus: infrastructure & team assembly*

1. Executive leadership: Hire CRO / VP Sales and VP Marketing to transition to a structured enterprise motion.  
2. GTM capacity: Recruit and onboard the 2027 growth pod (12 AEs \+ SE/SDR support). Front-load hires to match the enterprise ramp curve.  
3. Revenue milestone: Reach **$6M ARR**, validating the playbook while the team ramps.

### Phase 2: The scale (months 13–24 — 2027\)

*Focus: velocity & expansion*

1. Revenue acceleration: The 2026 hires reach full productivity, driving net new ARR to hit **$18M ARR**.  
2. Expansion motion: Activate land-and-expand within the installed base (e.g., single-site → multi-region contracts).  
3. **Series B readiness**: Exit 2027 with $18M+ ARR, top-tier efficiency, and a fully staffed sales org.

## 11\) Business Model & Unit Economics

IOMETE operates a high-margin enterprise software model. Unlike SaaS peers (Snowflake/Databricks) that act as resellers of cloud compute (depressing margins), IOMETE monetizes **software IP**, while the customer pays the infrastructure provider directly.

Model:

* Pricing: ARR priced per **vCPU/year** (compute capacity)  
* Gross margins: 90%+ (pure software margins); we do not carry the infrastructure COGS

Land & expand (NRR): expansion is structural via site expansion and workload consolidation.

1. Land: First deployment in one region or use case  
2. Expand:  
   * **Workload migration**: move more legacy workloads to retire Cloudera/Hadoop licenses  
   * **Adoption growth**: more teams onboard; concurrency increases; more compute allocated → higher vCPU/year  
   * **Multi-site rollout**: expand to additional data centers (e.g., Dell from 1 region to 6\)

## 12\) Investment Ask & Capital Allocation

We are raising a **$30M** Series A to fund the **24-month execution plan**.

**Primary use of proceeds**: weighted toward **GTM**, as the product is mature and proven at scale.

* **50% — GTM expansion**  
  * Hire CRO/VP Sales and Marketing leadership  
  * Recruit the “2027 growth pod” (12 enterprise AEs \+ SDRs)  
  * Build partnerships (SI/consulting channels)  
* **30% — Product & engineering**  
  * Product hardening and platform velocity (reliability \+ customer-pulled features)  
  * Reduce deployment friction (automated onboarding for private clouds)  
  * Note: this is acceleration, not core R\&D risk  
* **20% — Customer success & delivery**  
  * Scale Solutions Engineering to support parallel deployments  
  * Protect time-to-production and sustain high NRR via white-glove onboarding

## 13\) Closing anchor

IOMETE deliberately built the runway first. The next phase is takeoff — with capital, leadership, and a clear plan to build a repeatable enterprise growth engine.

## Appendices

## Appendix A \- Key Risks & Mitigations

1\. **Risk: Enterprise sales velocity (long cycles)**

* Concern: Fortune-500 infrastructure sales often involve 9–12 month cycles.  
* Mitigation:  
  * “Hair-on-fire” ICP: Buyers facing regulatory deadlines or major renewal hikes from legacy vendors.  
  * Senior GTM injection: Seasoned CRO and enterprise pod bring proven close discipline and network.

**2\. Risk: Deployment friction (on-prem complexity)**

* Concern: Private infrastructure is harder than a SaaS sign-up.  
* Mitigation:  
  * “SaaS-ification” of delivery: Automated K8s installers and reference architectures (e.g., Dell blueprint).  
  * Forward-deployed engineering: Drive first value in days, not months.

**3\. Risk: Competitive response (incumbents)**

* Concern: Databricks or Snowflake moves on-prem.  
* Mitigation:  
  * Structural moat: Public-cloud vendors can’t pivot to on-prem without cannibalizing their core consumption model; their architecture is tied to cloud partners.  
  * “Switzerland” stance: IOMETE is infrastructure-neutral; we win by being truly agnostic.
