## 3 years growth plan

$50M ARR in three years is an aggressive but deliberate target, and how we plan to reach it by moving from founder-led growth to a capacity-driven enterprise GTM engine. 

This plan becomes realistic now — and was not earlier — because product–market fit is validated, the platform is enterprise-ready with proven large-scale deployments, and the remaining constraint to growth is go-to-market capacity, which capital directly unlocks.

**Why $50M ARR in 3 years is aggressive from $2.1M**

$50M ARR in three years is aggressive because it requires sustained 3–4× annual growth from an already meaningful revenue base. The only way to achieve that is by moving from founder-limited sales to a capacity-driven enterprise GTM engine.

**How to get $50M ARR in 3 years**

Our primary growth driver is direct enterprise sales of large, multi-year contracts. To execute this, we will build senior GTM leadership and hire and ramp a focused enterprise sales team, shifting growth from founder-limited to capacity-driven. Revenue growth will compound through a combination of new enterprise logos and expansion within existing accounts, with geographic expansion and partnerships acting as amplifiers of the same core motion.
