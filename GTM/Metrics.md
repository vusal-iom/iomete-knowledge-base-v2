# Companywide Metrics

## 1. Revenue & Retention Metrics

| Metric                        | Benchmark Range             | IOMETE Pick | Note                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ACV (Annual Contract Value)   | $60k – $120k (Initial Land) | $100k       | Unlike pure SaaS which can land at $15k, on-prem requires a minimum commit to justify the deployment effort.                              |
| NRR (Net Revenue Retention)   | 115% – 125%                 | 120%        |                                                                                                                                           |
| GRR (Gross Revenue Retention) | 90% – 95%                   | 95%         | Because you are infrastructure, churn should be incredibly low. If GRR drops below 90%, your product has failed the technical validation. |
| Expansion Rate                | 20% – 30% YoY               | 20%         | In the private cloud, expansion happens in step functions (e.g., buying a new block of licenses) rather than smooth monthly ramping.      |

## 2. Sales Efficiency (Unit Economics)

| Metric             | Benchmark Range           | IOMETE Pick | Note                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CAC Payback Period | 12 – 18 Months            | 18 Months   | SaaS aims for <12 months. However, for On-Prem/Private Cloud, 15–18 months is acceptable because contracts are usually multi-year.                          |
| LTV : CAC Ratio    | 3:1 (Good) to 5:1 (Great) | 5:1         | High ACV and low churn drive high LTV. Investors will forgive a high CAC if the LTV is 5x.                                                                  |
| Magic Number       | 0.7 – 1.0                 | 1           | (New ARR / Sales & Marketing Spend). Being highly efficient (>1.0) is hard in on-prem markets due to long sales cycles. 0.75 is a safe modeling assumption. |

## 3. The Sales Funnel (Velocity)

| Metric              | Benchmark Range | IOMETE Pick | Note                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sales Cycle Length  | 6 – 9 Months    | 6 Months    | From first meeting to closed-won. Involves security reviews, POCs, and procurement.                                     |
| POC Conversion Rate | 60% – 75%       | 75%         | If you get to the POC stage in a private cloud environment, you must close the majority. POCs are expensive to support. |
| SQL to Close Rate   | 20% – 25%       | 20%         | (Sales Qualified Lead to Win). Lower than PLG but standard for enterprise sales.                                        |
| Pipeline Coverage   | 3.5x – 4.0x     | 5x          | You need ~4x your quota in pipeline to hit targets given deal slippage risk (budget/IT delays).                         |

## 4. Sales Organization (Headcount & Quota)

| Metric                   | Benchmark Range           | IOMETE Pick         | Note                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AE Quota (Annual)        | $800k – $1.2M             | $1M                 | For Series A/B stage. Mature enterprise reps (Series C+) carry $1.5M+.                                                               |
| OTE (On Target Earnings) | $220k – $300k             | $300k               |                                                                                                                                      |
| Quota : OTE Ratio        | 3x – 5x                   | 3x                  |                                                                                                                                      |
| Ramp Time                | 4 – 6 Months              | 6 Months            |                                                                                                                                      |
| AE : SE Ratio            | 1.5–1 : 2                 | 2:1                 | 1 SE supports 2 AEs.                                                                                                                 |
| AE : SDR Ratio           | 1:2                       | 1:2                 | Avoid high-volume SaaS ratio (1:4). With ACV > $100k, SDRs must focus on quality meetings.                                           |
| CSM Coverage             | 1 CSM per $1.5M – $2M ARR | 1 CSM per $1M ARR   |                                                                                                                                      |
| Span of Control          | 1 Manager : 6–8 ICs       | 1 Manager : 6–8 ICs | Standard across B2B tech. If you have 8 AEs, you need a VP Sales or Sales Director. If you have 8 SEs, you need a Head of Pre-Sales. |
