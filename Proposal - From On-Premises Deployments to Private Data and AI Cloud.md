# **From On-Premises Deployments to Private Data and AI Cloud**

## *IOMETE Strategic Position Paper | Internal Discussion Document | February 2026*

# **Executive Summary**

IOMETE has reached approximately $4M ARR with a data lakehouse platform adopted by regulated enterprises that cannot rely on public cloud. We have established enterprise trust through a long-term, multi-million-dollar deployment with Dell Technologies, and we have early evidence that Private Data Cloud delivery can work through operator-led, SaaS-like models such as Pasha Technology. In parallel, our public-sector and regulated financial deployments indicate sustained demand for sovereign and controlled data platforms.

This document outlines a strategic direction for IOMETE: moving from individual on-premises deployments toward deliberately building a Private Data and AI Cloud through cloud partnerships and selective large-enterprise platforms. This direction implies changes to our go-to-market focus, product roadmap, and organizational priorities, with the objective of scaling beyond one-off deployments over the next 18–24 months.

# **1\. Current Situation: Where We Are Today**

## 1.1  Revenue Composition

| Customer | Model Type | ARR | % of Total |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Dell Technologies | Enterprise Private Cloud | $3,500,000 | 89.1% |
| Uzbekistan Digital Ministry | On-Premises | $200,000 | 5.1% |
| Central Bank of Azerbaijan | On-Premises | $150,000 | 3.8% |
| Pasha Technology (Pasha Bank tenant) | Private Cloud | $50,000 | 1.3% |
| Overdrive | On-Premises (SME) | $30,000 | 0.8% |
| **Total** |  | **$3,930,000** | **100%** |

## 1.2  Key Observation

Dell Technologies represents 89% of our revenue. The remaining 11% breaks down as follows:

**On-premises deployments** (Uzbekistan, Central Bank of Azerbaijan, Overdrive): $380K — traditional model, high deployment effort per customer  
**Private cloud tenant** (Pasha Bank via Pasha Technology): $50K with expansion expected — early proof of multi-tenant model

This revenue mix highlights the strategic challenge: we are winning enterprise deals, but the on-premises model dominates. The Private Data Cloud motion (Pasha) is early and indicates a possible path forward.

# **2\.  The Problem: Traditional On-Premises GTM Does Not Scale**

## 2.1  Operational Challenges

**Long Sales Cycles:** Enterprise on-prem deals require 6-18 months of engagement including technical evaluation, security review, procurement, and budget approval.

**High Deployment Complexity:** Each deployment requires Object Storage configuration, Kubernetes setup, networking, security hardening, and custom integration work.

**N Customers \= N Deployments:** Every new customer means starting from zero on infrastructure. Professional services overhead can reach 25-40% of deal value.

**SME Distraction:** We are spending significant time closing $30K-$200K deals with small and medium enterprises. The sales effort is nearly identical to larger deals, but the revenue impact is 10-50x smaller.

**Limited Expansion:** Unlike consumption-based cloud models, on-prem expansion requires new procurement cycles and budget approvals.

## 2.2  Competitive Crowding

The on-premises data platform market is crowded with established players: Cloudera, Dremio, Starburst, and others. Competing here means fighting for share in an existing category where buyers already have mental models and vendor relationships.

Today, IOMETE is positioned as "better Cloudera" — more modern architecture, easier to operate, better economics. There is nothing wrong with this positioning for direct enterprise deals. But it traps us in comparison-based selling. Every deal becomes a feature-by-feature bake-off against incumbents with larger sales teams and deeper customer relationships.

The strategic question: can we escape this competitive dynamic entirely by creating a new category where these players do not compete?

## 2.3  The Capital Barrier for SMEs

Small and medium enterprises represent significant long-term potential — today's 500-person company may be tomorrow's 5,000-person enterprise. But on-premises deployment creates a capital barrier that excludes them from our market entirely.

On-prem requires substantial upfront investment: storage hardware, compute infrastructure, networking, and the technical staff to operate it. For an SME, this means $200K-$500K+ in infrastructure before they can even begin using a data platform. Most cannot justify this spend.

These companies are not rejecting IOMETE — they are rejecting the deployment model. A SaaS-like consumption model would make them accessible. The Private Data Cloud strategy unlocks this: SMEs become tenants on cloud operator infrastructure, paying only for what they use, with zero upfront capital requirement.

## 2.4  The Contrast That Matters

| Metric | SME On-Prem Deal | Dell-Scale Deal |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Typical ACV | $30K \- $200K | $1M \- $5M+ |
| Sales Cycle | 3–9 months | 6–12 months |
| Deployment Effort | High (custom each time) | High (custom each time) |
| Revenue per Engineering Hour | Low | High |
| Strategic Value | Limited | High (reference, expansion) |

The time spent on SME on-prem deals yields diminishing returns. We need a model that captures SME revenue without SME deployment overhead.

# **3\.  The Strategic Hypothesis: Private Data and AI Cloud Leadership**

## 3.1  Core Thesis

A significant portion of global enterprises cannot use public cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) due to data sovereignty, regulatory compliance, and security requirements. Databricks and Snowflake are effectively inaccessible to these customers.

Simultaneously, every country and region is building private cloud infrastructure: government clouds for the publicfor public sector, private clouds for regulated industries, and enterprise private clouds for large organizations.

**IOMETE will become the Private Data and AI Cloud** — delivering Databricks-class capabilities wherever customers need to run: government clouds, private clouds, or enterprise infrastructure.

## 3.2  The Model Shift

| Traditional On-Prem Model | Private Data Cloud Model |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1 customer \= 1 deployment | 1 deployment \= N tenants |
| Sell to end customer directly | Partner with cloud operator, tenants onboard via SaaS |
| Large upfront license \+ PS | Revenue share on tenant consumption |
| Expansion requires new procurement | Expansion is automatic (usage-based) |
| Sales cycle: 6–18 months per customer | Sales cycle: 6–12 months per partnership, then tenant onboarding in weeks |
| Linear scaling (more customers \= more deployments) | Leveraged scaling (more tenants on existing deployments) |

## 3.3  Target Cloud Environments

**Government Clouds:** National and regional government cloud infrastructure serving public sector agencies. IOMETE provides multi-tenant data and AI platform; all ministries and agencies use IOMETE as SaaS from their government cloud. Example: Uzbekistan Digital Ministry.

**Private Clouds (Service Providers):** Regional technology companies operating private cloud infrastructure for holding companies, conglomerates, and enterprise customers. Example: Pasha Technology serving holding assets.

**Enterprise Private Clouds:** Large enterprises operating internal private cloud infrastructure for their own business units and subsidiaries. These organizations treat their internal infrastructure as a private cloud. Example: Dell Technologies internal data cloud.

# **4\.  Why This Strategy Wins**

## 4.1  Competitive Vacuum

Snowflake and Databricks have no incentive to pursue Private Data Cloud markets. Their sales teams generate higher commissions from single Fortune 500 deals than from building government cloud partnerships in emerging markets. They are optimized for AWS, Azure, and GCP. We go where they will not.

## 4.2  Partner Alignment

Many partner-led GTM strategies underperform because partners lack sufficient incentive. In our model, the cloud operator desperately needs us. Without a data platform, their cloud is commodity infrastructure (compute and storage). IOMETE makes their cloud valuable and differentiated. This creates genuine alignment.

## 4.3  Multi-Tenant Economics

This is a structural change in the model. One deployment, many tenants. Our marginal cost to add tenant \#15 is near zero. We achieve SaaS economics in a market that has been trapped in on-prem economics. This fundamentally changes CAC payback and gross margin structure.

## 4.4  Regulatory Moat

Once IOMETE is the data platform inside a government cloud, we become the default. Every new ministry, every new agency, every new regulation requiring sovereign data flows to us. Switching costs increase over time.

## 4.5  AI Timing

AI is forcing every government to invest in data infrastructure now. We are not selling a data lakehouse. We are selling AI-ready data infrastructure you control. This framing can influence budgeting and procurement discussions.

## 4.6  Enterprise Private Data Cloud Narrative

This strategy also strengthens our Fortune 500 pitch by reframing IOMETE from an on-prem data platform to the foundation for an enterprise's own Private Data and AI Cloud. For central data platform teams, this is a more forward-looking and differentiated mandate: building a shared internal data and AI platform rather than operating fragmented deployments. Dell demonstrates that large enterprises are willing to invest meaningfully in this model when it aligns with long-term platform strategy.

# **5\.  Current Proof Points**

## 5.1  Early Proof of the Strategic Hypothesis

Dell Technologies and Pasha Technology provide early evidence supporting the Private Data and AI Cloud strategy. Dell shows that a large enterprise has chosen to build and invest in an internal Private Data and AI Cloud as a long-term platform. Pasha Technology provides early evidence for an operator-led Private Data Cloud delivery model, where IOMETE is deployed as isolated, single-tenant environments but operated and managed centrally by the provider and delivered to customers in a SaaS-like manner. Pasha Bank is live as the first tenant, with additional banks (including Kapital Bank) onboarding.

| Partnership | Model Type | Status | What It Proves |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Dell Technologies | Enterprise Private Cloud | Live (6 data centers, $3.5M/yr, 5-year contract) | Large enterprises will invest in building an internal Private Data and AI Cloud platform |
| Pasha Technology | Private Cloud (Service Provider) | Live (1 tenant: Pasha Bank at $50K ARR, expansion underway) | Operator-led Private Data Cloud delivery works with centrally managed, isolated single-tenant deployments |

## 5.2  Signal of Sovereign and Regulated Market Demand

In parallel, our public-sector and regulated financial deployments indicate demand for sovereign, controlled data platforms. While these implementations predate the full Private Data Cloud motion, they validate the regulatory and sovereignty drivers that underpin this strategy.

| Partnership | Model Type | Status | What It Proves |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Uzbekistan Digital Ministry | On-Premises | Live ($200K ARR) | Governments require sovereign, controlled data platforms |
| Central Bank of Azerbaijan | On-Premises | Live ($150K ARR) | Regulated financial institutions trust IOMETE in high-compliance environments |

# **6\.  Strategic Implications**

## 6.1  Product Roadmap Implications

**Multi-Tenancy as Core:** Product architecture must evolve toward multi-tenant deployment as a target state. Tenant isolation, resource allocation, and usage metering become first-class features over time.

**Self-Service Tenant Onboarding:** Reduce friction for new tenants. The cloud operator should be able to provision new tenant environments without IOMETE engineering involvement.

**Usage-Based Metering:** Granular consumption tracking to support future revenue-share models. Metering should work consistently across isolated single-tenant and future multi-tenant deployments.

**Operator Management & Operations Capabilities:** Beyond deployment, Private Cloud Providers need robust capabilities to serve customers at scale. This includes centralized visibility across tenant environments, operational monitoring, alerting, troubleshooting, lifecycle management, upgrades, backup and recovery, and support tooling that allows operators to manage, diagnose, and resolve issues without deep IOMETE involvement.

## 6.2  GTM Implications

**Partnership-First Motion:** Primary GTM motion shifts from direct enterprise sales to cloud operator partnerships. Success metric changes from "deals closed" to "partnerships activated" and "tenants onboarded."

**Regional Focus:** Prioritize regions with active private cloud investment and regulatory drivers. US, EU, and Middle East are priority markets.

**Deal Size Discipline:** Maintain $500K ACV minimum for direct deals. Below that threshold, route to cloud partnerships or decline.

**Large Enterprises Building Internal Private Data Clouds:** Selectively pursue $1M+ ACV engagements with Fortune 500 (US) and similarly scaled global enterprises that are explicitly building an internal Private Data and AI Cloud. These are treated as platform partnerships, not transactional enterprise deals, with a focus on internal enablement, standardization, and long-term expansion.

## 6.3  Organizational Implications

**Partnership Team:** Build dedicated partnership development function separate from direct sales.

**Tenant Success:** Create tenant success function to drive adoption within cloud partnerships.

**Regional Expertise:** Develop regulatory and relationship expertise in priority regions.

# **7\.  What We Are Choosing Not to Do**

Strategic clarity requires explicit trade-offs. The following are deliberate choices, not oversights:

## 7.1  Stop Pursuing SME On-Prem Deals

**The Decision:** We will no longer actively pursue direct on-premises deals below $500K ACV.

**Why:** A $50K deal requires nearly the same sales cycle, technical evaluation, and deployment effort as a $500K deal. Our engineering and sales bandwidth is finite. Every hour spent on a $30K POC is an hour not spent on a Private Data Cloud partnership that could yield $2M+ over time.

**Exception:** If an SME approaches us through an existing cloud partnership (as a tenant), we welcome them. The difference is deployment overhead: zero for a tenant, significant for direct on-prem.

**Risk:** We may lose some near-term revenue. Some SMEs could have become larger accounts. We accept this trade-off for focus.

## 7.2  No Geographic Spray

**The Decision:** We will not pursue cloud partnerships in all regions simultaneously. We will focus on 3-4 priority regions where Private Data Cloud momentum is strongest.

**Why:** Each region requires regulatory knowledge, local relationships, and often local presence. Spreading thin means executing poorly everywhere. Concentrated wins in 3-4 regions build a reputationbuild reputation that pulls other regions toward us.

**Priority Regions:** Central Asia (existing footprint), Middle East (strong private cloud investment), EU (GDPR-driven demand), and selectively Southeast Asia.

## 7.3  No White-Label or OEM Deals

**The Decision:** IOMETE brand remains visible to end tenants. We do not allow cloud operators to white-label our platform as their own.

**Why:** Brand visibility drives long-term value. If tenants know they are using IOMETE, we build market awareness, can collect references, and maintain leverage in partnership negotiations. White-label commoditizes us.

**Risk:** Some cloud operators may prefer white-label. We may lose some partnerships. We accept this to protect long-term positioning.

## 7.4  No Custom Development for Individual Tenants

**The Decision:** We will not build tenant-specific features or customizations. Product roadmap is driven by platform-wide priorities, not individual tenant requests.

**Why:** Custom development destroys multi-tenant economics. The moment we fork the product for one tenant, we inherit the maintenance burden forever. This is the Cloudera trap. We avoid it by policy.

**Exception:** If a feature request benefits all tenants across multiple partnerships, it becomes a roadmap candidate. The test is: does this make the platform better for everyone?

## 7.5  No Competing with Cloud Operators

**The Decision:** We will not sell directly to end customers in regions where we have active cloud partnerships.

**Why:** Channel conflict kills partnerships. If a government ministry in Uzbekistan wants IOMETE, they go through the Digital Ministry cloud. We do not undercut our partners. This builds trust and long-term partnership value.

**Exception:** Enterprise private cloud deals (like Dell) where the enterprise IS the cloud operator for their own use.

# **8\.  Risk Acknowledgment and Contingencies (WIP)**

This strategy carries meaningful risks. We acknowledge them explicitly:

## 8.1  Tenant Ramp Risk

**Risk:** Tenant adoption within cloud partnerships may be slower than projected. Government procurement moves slowly. Cloud operators may lack sales capability.

## 8.2  Cloud Partner Dependency Risk

**Risk:** Cloud operators may fail to invest in their own growth. A government cloud that never attracts agencies is useless to us. We are coupling our growth to infrastructure we do not control.

**Mitigation:** Partnership qualification criteria before signing: operator must have existing customer base, active investment in cloud infrastructure, and clear go-to-market plan for tenant acquisition.

## 8.3  Databricks/Snowflake Entry Risk

**Risk:** Databricks or Snowflake could decide to pursue Private Data Cloud markets aggressively, leveraging their brand and resources.

**Mitigation:** Move fast. Our 3-5 year window assumes they remain focused on hyperscaler growth. Every partnership we sign, every tenant we onboard, deepens our moat. First-mover advantage in Private Data Cloud markets is substantial due to regulatory relationships and switching costs.

**Contingency:** If a major player enters, we compete on: (a) existing embedded position, (b) superior Private Data Cloud optimization, (c) pricing flexibility they cannot match. We may also become an acquisition target, which is not the worst outcome.

# **9\.  The Bet We Are Making**

This strategy is a bet on timing and execution.

**Timing Bet:** We are betting that demand for sovereign and private data infrastructure will materialize faster than incumbent data cloud vendors adapt their products and GTM to these environments. This creates a window to establish embedded positions with cloud operators and large enterprises before these markets become a priority for hyperscaler-centric platforms.

**Execution Bet:** We are betting that a focused set of cloud partnerships and selective large-enterprise deployments can be activated within 18–24 months, and that SaaS-like delivery through centrally managed private deployments is sufficient to reach scale before full multi-tenancy is required.

**Outcome:** If these bets hold, IOMETE can establish a defensible leadership position in Private Data and AI Cloud infrastructure, with embedded deployments that are difficult for later entrants to displace.

# **Conclusion**

IOMETE is at an inflection point. We have demonstrated enterprise trust through large-scale deployments such as Dell, and we have early evidence that Private Data Cloud delivery can work through operator-led, SaaS-like models such as Pasha. In parallel, our public-sector and regulated deployments indicate sustained demand for sovereign and controlled data platforms.

The strategic choice ahead is to shift from operating as an on-premises vendor competing deal-by-deal to deliberately building the Private Data and AI Cloud through a combination of cloud partnerships and selective large-enterprise platforms. This direction concentrates our product, GTM, and organizational efforts on models that can scale beyond individual deployments.

This document is intended to align the team in thaton that direction and define the priorities, trade-offs, and execution focus required over the next 18–24 months.
